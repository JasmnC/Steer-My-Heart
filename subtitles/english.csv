s1-3,Why did you have to leave me like this? We never had enough time…

s1-6,I can't imagine how you must be feeling. She was an incredible person. 
s1-8,Don't pretend like you understand

s1-21,"What's the point of this conference anyway? Why are we celebrating her achievements now, when it's too late?"
s1-22,"I understand your anger. The conference is meant to honor her intelligence and the remarkable work she did, even if it can't bring her back."

s2-10,"But you know what? I've learned to embrace change, to make peace with uncertainty. It's the only way to move forward."
s3-5,I'm sorry about what happened earlier. I'm not myself right now.
s3-6,It's okay. I understand.

s3-10," I know, but I still feel like I missed out on something. Like I didn't get enough time with her."
