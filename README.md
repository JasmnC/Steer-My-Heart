# Steer My Heart
### A python generated storybook inspired by Japanese movie Drive My Car

## Introduction

This project, developed as part of 6105 data science class, focuses on implementing multiple python libraries for image processing to enhance and modify the images. 
All of the enhancment and modification were done in python. Additionally, we adopt Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED) network for edge and shape detection.

## Overview

The project utilizes various image processing techniques such as brightness adjustment, blurring, and border addition have been implemented. Moreover, we applied the HED network for holistic edge detection in images. The code includes functionality to generate customized layouts, insert subtitles, and combine images, resulting in visually appealing outputs.

## Features

- Holistic Nested Edge Detection
- Image Brightening and Darkening
- Gaussian Blur Application
- Border Addition to Images
- Custom Layout Generation
- Subtitle Integration
- Image Combination
